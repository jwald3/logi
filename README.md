# logi

A JavaFX application that provides CRUD functionality for planning logistical operations. The app allows users to add, access, edit, and delete records of trucks, trips, and facilities that are hosted on local MySQL storage. The project showcases utilization of MySQL querying through the JDBC API in addition to understanding MVC fundamentals. Each Truck, Trip, and Facility has an associated entity class and each app view has an FXML file built through Scene Builder, a controller dedicated to interactivity in the page, and state transfer across pages.
